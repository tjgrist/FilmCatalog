# FilmCatalog
This film catalog system offers the user the ability to peruse a number of genres and their titles. 

The user can aggregate two genres, using the overloaded + operator function, as well as create new genres based on their selected titles. 

Each time a new genre is made, the genre is named and can be viewed by the user.
